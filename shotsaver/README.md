Currently implemented:
* Qubit-wise commutation method [arXiv:1907.03358]

To be implemented:
* QWC-"sorted insertion" [arXiv:2201.01471,2205.07113,1908.06942]
* Half-orthogonalization and extrapolation
* SMALD (string-matching and local diagonalization)

Dependencies:
* Scipy
* OpenFermion
* NetworkX
* pprint
