# Test parts_organizer.py



from . import parts_organizer


"""

Test:
- SI FC
- SI QWC
- SI k-QWC
- noclid-greedy (using tensortrain objects)
- noclid-blocked
- bosonic (maybe even write new code for bosonic? 
yea, could be specific to this module.
or could just have mat2qubit as dependency. maybe
not the worst idea. but of course you'd have to
have mat2qubit be installable from pip.)
